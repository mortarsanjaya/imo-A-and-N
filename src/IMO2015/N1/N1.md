# IMO 2015 N1

For any integer $n$, denote $f(n) = n \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$.
Find all integers $M$ for which $f^k(M)$ is even for some $k \geq 0$.



# Answer

$M \neq 3$.



# Solution

Official solution: <http://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2015SL.pdf>

We follow Solution 2 of the official solution.
That is, we first prove that $f^k(3)$ is odd for all $k \geq 0$.
Then we show that, if $f^k(M)$ is odd for all $k \geq 0$, then $M \equiv 3 \pmod{2^m}$ for all $m \geq 1$.
Picking $m$ big enough forces $M = 3$.


# Extra notes

While this version looks different from the official version, it is actually the same.
The sequence $a_0, a_1, \ldots$ defined by $a_0 = \frac{2M + 1}{2}$ and $a_{k + 1} = a_k \lfloor a_k \rfloor$ for $k \geq 0$ is precisely determined by $a_k = \frac{f^k(2M + 1)}{2}$.

We work in `int` instead of `nat`, which means it is more comfortable at handling modulo equivalences.
The solution still works with any integer $M$.
