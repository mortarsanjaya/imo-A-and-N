# IMO 2015 A2

Determine all functions $f : \Z \to \Z$ such that, for all $x, y \in \Z$,
$$ f(x - f(y)) = f(f(x)) - f(y) - 1. $$



# Answer

$f = -1$ and $f = x \mapsto x + 1$.



# Solution

Official solution: <http://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2015SL.pdf>

We will follow Solution 1 of the official solution with a slight modification described below.

After obtaining $f(x) = Ax + B$, we do not need to fully substitute it into $f(f(x)) = f(x + 1)$.
Instead, just substitute once: $A f(x) + B = A (x + 1) + B$.
Then either $A = 0$, which leads to $f = -1$, or $f(x) = x + 1$ for all $x \in \Z$.
