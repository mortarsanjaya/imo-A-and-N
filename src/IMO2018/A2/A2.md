# IMO 2018 A2 (P2)

Find all positive integers $n \geq 3$ for which there exists real numbers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ such that $a_i a_{i + 1} + 1 = a_{i + 2}$ for each $i \leq n$.
Here, we denote $a_{n + 1} = a_1$ and $a_{n + 2} = a_2$.

## Extra

For each $n \geq 3$, find all the possible sequences $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$.




# Answer

$n$ is a multiple of $3$.



# Solution

Official solution: <https://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2018SL.pdf>

We follow the rather magical (but short) Solution 2 of the official solution.
We also prove more:
1. If the sequence is periodic, then it must be 3-periodic.
2. The corresponding sequence must be $-1, -1, 2, -1, -1, 2, \ldots$.
We implement the real numbers as an $n$-periodic function $a : \N \to \R$.
