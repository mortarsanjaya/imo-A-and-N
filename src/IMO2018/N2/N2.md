Let $n$ be a positive integer.
Consider an $n \times n$ table, where each cell contains an integer congruent to $1$ modulo $n$.
Suppose that the sum of all numbers in an arbitrary row or column is congruent to $n$ modulo $n^2$.
For each $i \leq n$, let $R_i$ and $C_i$ be the product of numbers in the $i$th row and $i$th column, respectively.
Prove that
$$ \sum_{i = 1}^n R_i \equiv \sum_{i = 1}^n C_i \pmod{n^4}. $$



# Solution

Let $S = \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$.
Represent the table as a function $f : S^2 \to \Z$.
The result is obtained by applying the following lemma several times.

> __Lemma__:
> Let $n$ be an integer and $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k$ be integers congruent to $1$ modulo $n$.
> Then we have the congruence
> $$ \prod_{i = 1}^k a_i + k \equiv \sum_{i = 1}^k a_i + 1 \pmod{n^2}. $$

> __Proof__:
> For any $x, y \in \Z$ such that $x \equiv y \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$, it is easy to check that $xy + 2 \equiv x + y + 1 \pmod{n^2}$; this is equivalent to $n^2 \mid (x - 1)(y - 1)$.
> The rest follows by induction on $k$.

Now this means for each $i \leq n$,
$$ R_i + n \equiv \sum_{j = 1}^n f(i, j) + 1 \equiv n + 1 \pmod{n^2} \implies R_i \equiv 1 \pmod{n^2}. $$
Similarly, $C_j \equiv 1 \pmod{n^2}$ for each $j \leq n$.
Applying the lemma again with $n^2$ replacing $n$ yields
$$ \sum_{i = 1}^n R_i + 1 \equiv \prod_{i = 1}^n R_i + k \pmod{n^4}, $$
$$ \sum_{j = 1}^n C_j + 1 \equiv \prod_{j = 1}^n C_j + k \pmod{n^4}, $$
But $\prod_{i = 1}^n R_i = \prod_{j = 1}^n C_j = \prod_{(i, j) \in S^2} f(i, j)$.
So we are done.
