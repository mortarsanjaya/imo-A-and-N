# IMO 2019 A2

Let $R$ be a linear ordered commutative ring and $n \geq 2$ be a positive integer.
Let $u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_n$ be elements of $R$ such that
$$ \sum_{i = 1}^n u_i = 0, \quad \sum_{i = 1}^n u_i^2 = 1. $$
Prove that
$$ n \min_{i \leq n} u_i \cdot \max_{i \leq n} u_i \leq -1. $$



# Solution

Official solution: <https://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2019SL.pdf>

We follow Solution 1 of the official solution.
More generally, we prove the following result.

> __Theorem__:
> Let $k$ and $m$ be positive integers.
> Let $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k, b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m \in R$ non-negative such that
> $$ \sum_{i = 1}^k a_i = \sum_{j = 1}^m b_j. $$
> Then,
> $$ (k + m) \max_{i \leq k} a_i \cdot \max_{j \leq m} b_j \geq \sum_{i = 1}^k a_i^2 + \sum_{j = 1}^m b_j^2. $$



# Implementation details

We will use `multiset` to represent the sequence.
