# IMO 2011 A3, Generalized Version

Let $R$ be a commutative ring such that $2$ has an inverse in $R$.
Determine all pairs of $(f, g)$ functions from $R$ to $R$ such that, for all $x, y \in R$,
$$ g(f(x + y)) = f(x) + (2x + y) g(y). $$



# Answer

$(f, g) = (x \mapsto Ax^2 + C, x \mapsto Ax)$ for some $A, C âˆˆ R$, such that $A(A - 1) = C(A - 1) = 0$.

If $R$ is an integral domain (e.g. $\R$, as in the original case), $(f, g) = (x \mapsto x^2 + C, x \mapsto x)$ and $(f, g) = (0, 0)$.



# Solution

Official solution: https://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2011SL.pdf.

We adapt the official solution for our generalization.
The solution steps work for any commutative ring that contains $1/2$ (i.e. an inverse of $2$).
However, after getting $g = x \mapsto Ax + B$ and $f = x \mapsto Ax^2 - Bx + C$, all we can find is that $A^2 = A$, $B = 0$, and $AC = C$; nothing more than that.

If $R$ is an __integral domain__ containing $1/2$, then we are able to obtain either $A = C = 0$ or $A = 1$.



# Notes

It seems that the case $char(R) = 2$ is too ugly to even consider, let alone the general case where $R$ might not contain an inverse of $2$.
