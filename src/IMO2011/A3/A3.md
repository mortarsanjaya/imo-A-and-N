# IMO 2011 A3, Generalized Version

Let $R$ be a commutative ring such that $2$ is not a zero divisor in $R$.
Determine all pairs of $(f, g)$ functions from $R$ to $R$ such that, for all $x, y \in R$,
$$ g(f(x + y)) = f(x) + (2x + y) g(y). $$



# Answer

$(f, g) = (x \mapsto Ax^2 + C, x \mapsto Ax)$ for some $A, C âˆˆ R$, such that $A(A - 1) = C(A - 1) = 0$.

If $R$ is an integral domain (e.g. $\R$, as in the original case), $(f, g) = (x \mapsto x^2 + C, x \mapsto x)$ and $(f, g) = (0, 0)$.



# Solution

Official solution: <https://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2011SL.pdf>

We adapt the official solution for our generalization.
However, the step of obtaining linearity of $R$ requires that $2$ is invertible in $R$.
Instead, we use the steps from the comment section, which only requires that $2$ is not a zero divisor in $R$.

After getting $g = x \mapsto Ax + B$ and $f = x \mapsto Ax^2 - Bx + C$, all we can find is that $A^2 = A$, $B = 0$, and $AC = C$.
In fact these also suffices for $(f, g)$ to satisfy the original equality.
If $R$ is an __integral domain__ of characteristic not equal to $2$, then we are able to obtain either $A = C = 0$ or $A = 1$.



# Extra Notes

It seems that the case where $R$ is an integral domain with characteristic $2$ is too ugly to consider.
Thus, we will not consider this case or the general case.
$R$ might not contain an inverse of $2$.
