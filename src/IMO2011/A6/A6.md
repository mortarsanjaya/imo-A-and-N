Let $R$ be a linear ordered commutative ring.
Let $f : R \to R$ be a function such that, for all $x, y \in R$,
$$ f(x + y) \leq y f(x) + f(f(x)). $$
Prove that $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \leq 0$.



# Solution

Official solution: <https://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2011SL.pdf>

We follow Solution 1 of the official solution.
However, there is a simpler way to prove $f(t) \leq 0$ for all $t \in R$ as follows.
Note that we have $x f(x) \leq 0$ for all $x \in R$ from Solution 1.
In particular, this means $f(x) \leq 0$ for $x > 0$.

Plugging $y = 0$ into the original inequality yields $f(x) \leq f(f(x))$ for every $x \in R$.
If $f(x) > 0$, then we get $0 < f(x) \leq f(f(x)) \leq 0$; a contradiction.
This shows that $f(x) \leq 0$ holds for any $x \in R$.
