# IMO 2021 A5

Let $F$ be a linear ordered field.
Let $n$ be an integer with $n \geq 2$.
Consider since $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \in F$ such that $a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n \leq 1$.
Prove that
$$ \sum_{k = 1}^n \frac{a_k}{1 - a_k} \left(\sum_{j = 1}^{k - 1} a_j\right)^2 < \frac{1}{3}. $$



# Solution

Official solution: <https://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2021SL.pdf>

We follow Solution 1.
Note that, in the original problem, we have a stronger condition: $a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n = 1$.



# Implementation Details

In Lean, division by zero is still well-defined; in fact results in zero.
Thus, we can remove the condition $n \geq 2$.
Indeed, even for $n = 1$ with $a_1 = 1$, the term $\frac{a_1}{1 - a_1} \left(\sum_{j = 1}^{1 - 1} a_j\right)^2$ will just be treated as $0$.
