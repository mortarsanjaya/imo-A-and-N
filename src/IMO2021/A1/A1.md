# IMO 2021 A1

Fix some $n \geq 1$.
Let $A$ be the subset of $\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, 5^n\}$ of size $4n + 2$.
Prove that there exists $a, b, c \in A$ such that $a < b < c$ and $c + 2a > 3b$.



# Solution

Official solution: <https://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2021SL.pdf>

We follow Solution 1 of the official solution.
We also make a version with strictly increasing function `N -> N` as a lemma.
