# IMO 2021 A8, Generalized Version

Let $R$ be an integral domain.
Find all functions $f : \R \to R$ such that, for all $a, b, c \in \R$,
$$ (f(a) - f(b)) (f(b) - f(c)) (f(c) - f(a)) = f(ab^2 + bc^2 + ca^2) - f(a^2 b + b^2 c + c^2 a). \tag{*} $$



# Answer

Either $f = C$, $f = x \mapsto \pm \phi(x) + C$, or $f = x \mapsto \pm \phi(x)^3 + C$ for some ring homomorphism $\phi : \R \to R$ and $C \in R$.

This is a solution in the AoPS thread for IMO 2021 A8 by __BlazingMuddy__ (post #8).
We will rewrite the solution here.

We denote the original equation by $(*)$.
First, it is clear that, if $f$ satisfies $(*)$, then $-f$ and $f + C$ satisfies $(*)$ for any constant $C \in R$.
Thus, whenever necessary, we can WLOG assume that $f(0) = 0$.
In particular, to check that all the answers above satisfy $(*)$, it suffices to check for $0$, $\phi$, and $x \mapsto \phi(x)^3$ for any ring homomorphism $\phi : \R \to R$.
The case $f = 0$ is trivial, while the case $f = \phi$ leads to an easy-to-check identity.
The final case, $f = x \mapsto \phi(x)^3$, is verifiable, although one needs to do a heavy bashing.
(In the `.lean` file, we just let the `ring` tactic verify the corresponding identity.)

We split into two main cases: $f$ is not injective, and $f$ is injective.
But before that, we prove one small lemma.

> Either way, the discriminant is indeed non-negative.


## Case 1: $f$ is not injective.

We prove that $f$ is constant.

For any $x, b, c \in \R$ such that $f(xb) = f(x)$, replacing $(a, b, c)$ with $(x, xb, xc)$ in $(*)$ gives us
$$ f(x^3 (b^2 + bc^2 + c)) = f (x^3 (b + b^2 c + c^2)). \tag{1} $$
This equation suffices to prove that $f$ is constant.

First, suppose that $f(t) = f(0)$ for some $t \neq 0$.
Plugging $a = t$ and $b = 0$ into $(*)$ yields $f(ct^2) = f(c^2 t)$ for any $c \in \R$.
That means we get $f(-ct^2) = f(c^2 t) = f(ct^2)$ for any $c \in \R$.
Replacing $c$ with $c/t^2$, we get that $f$ is even.

Now, suppose that $f$ is even.
Then we plugging $b = -1$ and $c = \varphi = \dfrac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$ into $(1)$ gives us $f(0) = f(2 \varphi x^3)$ for every $x \in \R$.
Replace $x$ with $\sqrt[3]{\frac{x}{2 \varphi}}$ to get that $f$ is constant.
Thus, it suffices to prove that $f(t) = f(0)$ for some $t \neq 0$.

We call a real number $b$ good if $f(xb) = f(x)$ for some $x \neq 0$.
Note that $f(t) = f(0)$ for some $t \neq 0$ is equivalent to $0$ being good.
From the assumption that $f$ is not injective, one can show that there exists a good real number not equal to $1$.
We show that the existence of such real number leads to $0$ being good as well.

Let $t$ be an arbitrary good real number.
If $t = 0$, then $0$ is good and we are done.
Next, suppose that $t < 1/2$ and $t \neq 0$.
By Lemma 1, there exists $u \in \R$ such that $t^2 + tu^2 + u = 0$.
Clearly $u \neq 0$, as $u = 0$ would imply $t = 0$ by the previous equation.
Plugging $b = t$ and $c = u$ with a suitable $x \neq 0$ into $(1)$ yields $f(0) = f(x^3 (t + t^2 u + u^2))$.
Note that $t + t^2 u + u^2 = t + u(t^2 + u) = t - tu^3 = t(1 - u^3)$.
If $u = 1$, then the equation $t^2 + tu^2 + u = 0$ becomes $t^2 + t + 1 = 0$, which has no solution in $\R$.
Otherwise, since $t \neq 0$, we have t + t^2 u + u^2 = t(1 - u^3) \neq 0$.
Since $x \neq 0$, this means that $0$ is indeed good.
Thus, it suffices to prove that there exists a good real number less than $1/2$.
To do this, we will use the following lemma.

> __Lemma 2__:
> If a real number $t \neq 0$ is good, then so is $t^4$.
>
> __Proof__:
> Plugging $b = t$ and $c = -t^2$ with a suitable $x \neq 0$ into $(1)$ gives us $f(x^3 t) = f(x^3 t^5)$.
> But $x, t \neq 0$, so this means $t^4$ is good, as desired.

Now, from the second previous paragraph, there exists a good real number not equal to $1$, say $t$.
If $t < 1/2$, we are done by the previous paragraph, so now suppose that $t \geq 1/2$.
From the definition of good real number, one can show that for any real number $b \neq 0$, if $b$ is good, then $b^{-1}$ is good as well.
Then, for $t > 1$, we can replace $t$ with $t^{-1}$, so WLOG we can assume that $t < 1$.
Using induction with Lemma 2 shows us that $t^{4^n}$ is good for every $n \geq 0$.
Finally, since $t < 1$, we have $t^{4^n} < 1/2$ for $n$ large enough, which means we are done as well.


## Case 2: $f$ is injective.

WLOG we will assume that $f(0) = 0$ for convenience.
We need to show that either $f = \pm \phi$, $f = x \mapsto \phi(x)^3$, or $f = x \mapsto -\phi(x)^3$ for some ring homomorphism $\phi : \R \to R$.
First, we show that $f$ is odd and $f(1) = \pm 1$.
By the fact that $-f$ satisfies $(*)$ if $f$ satisfies $(*)$, we can then assume WLOG that $f(1) = 1$.
Next, we show that $f$ is multiplicative.
From that point onwards, it suffices to prove that either $f$ or the map $x \mapsto f(\sqrt[3]{x})$ is additive to get the desired result.

Plugging $c = 0$ into $(*)$ yields the following equality for all $a, b \in \R$:
$$ f(a) f(b)^2 - f(a)^2 f(b) = f(ab^2) - f(a^2 b). \tag{2} $$
Subtracting $(2)$ with $(a, -1)$ from $(2)$ with $(a, -1)$ gives us
$$ (f(a) - f(-a)) f(1) (f(1) - f(a) - f(-a)) = f(a) - f(-a) $$
for any $a \in \R$.
For $a \neq 0$, since $f$ is injective, the equation becomes $f(1) (f(1) - f(a) - f(-a)) = 1$.
In particular, $f(1) \neq 0$, and there exists $C \in \R$ such that $f(a) + f(-a) = C$ for all $a \in \R \setminus \{0\}$.
To show that $f$ is odd and $f(1) = \pm 1$, it suffices to prove that $C = 0$.

For any $a \in \R$ such that $a \neq 0$ and $|a| \neq 1$, plugging $b = a^{-1}$ into $(2)$ yields $$ (f(a^{-1}) - f(a)) f(a) f(a^{-1}) = f(a^{-1}) - f(a) \implies f(a) f(a^{-1}) = 1. $$
Using $a = 2$ and $a = -2$ for the equation, we get
$$ 1 = f(-2) f(-2^{-1}) = (C - f(2)) (C - f(2^{-1})) = C (C - f(2) - f(2^{-1})) + 1. $$
So, either $C = 0$ or $C = f(2) + f(2^{-1})$.
For the latter case, we get $f(2) + f(-2) = f(2) + f(2^{-1})$, so $f(-2) = f(2^{-1})$.
This is impossible since $-2 \neq 2^{-1}$ in $\R$ and $f$ is injective.
Thus, $C = 0$, and thus $f$ is odd and $f(1) = \pm 1$.

From now on, WLOG assume that $f(1) = 1$.
Note that the existence of such $f$ means that $char(R) \neq 2$.
Indeed, for the case $char(R) = 2$, we have $f(-1) = -f(1) = -1 = 1 = f(1)$ since $f$ is odd and $-1 = 1$ in $R$.
But $-1 \neq 1$ in $\R$; a contradiction.
Thus, from now on, we can assume that $char(R) \neq 2$, so we can always cancel out a factor of $2$ from equations in $R$.

> __Lemma 3__:
> $f$ is multiplicative.
>
> __Proof__:
> Since $f$ is odd, adding $(2)$ with $(a, b)$ and with $(a, -b)$ yields
$2 f(a) f(b)^2 = 2 f(ab^2)$.
> Cancelling $2$ from both sides yield $f(a) f(b)^2 = f(ab^2)$ for all $a, b \in \R$.
> Plugging $a = 1$ yields $f(b)^2 = f(b^2)$ for all $b \in \R$.
> Then the previous equation simplifies to $f(a) f(b) = f(ab)$ for all $a, b \in \R$ with $b \geq 0$.
> Since $f$ is odd, it is easy to extend multiplicativity for all $a, b \in \R$.

> __Lemma 4__:
> For any $t \in \R$ with $t \neq 0$, we have
> $$ f(t^2 + t^{-1}) + f (t^2 - t^{-1}) = f(2) - 2 + 2 f(t)^2. $$

> So, we can WLOG assume that $t < 0$.
> By Lemma 1, there exists $u \in \R$ such that $t^2 + tu^2 + u = 0$.
> We can rewrite this as $t^2 + tu^2 = -u$.

> &= f(0) - f(-ut^{-1} + t^2 u) \\

> \end{align*}
> $$
> Meanwhile, plugging $(a, b, c) = (1, t, -u)$ into $(*)$ yields

> Subtracting the first equation from the second one gives

> Note that $u \neq 0$.
> Otherwise, $t + u^2 = -ut^{-1}$ yields $t = 0$, contradicting $t < 0$.
> Cancelling out $f(u)$ from both sides and rearranging yields the desired equality.

> __Lemma 5__:
> For any $t, u \in \R$,
> $$ 2 f(t^3 + u^3) = 2 (f(t)^3 + f(u)^3) + (f(2) - 2) (f(t) + f(u)) f(t) f(u). $$
> 
> __Proof__:
> It is sufficient to prove the following equality for $t, u \in \R$:
> $$ f(t^3 + u^3) + f(u^3 - t^3) = (f(2) - 2) f(t)^2 f(u) + 2 f(u)^3. $$
> The lemma holds by adding the above equality with $(t, u)$ and $(u, t)$ coupled with the fact that $f$ is odd.
>
> For $u = 0$, the equality holds because $f$ is odd.
> For $t = 0$, the equality holds since $f$ is multiplicative.
> For $t, u \neq 0$, dividing by $f(t)^2 f(u)$ and using multiplicativity, the equality becomes
> $$ f\left(t/u + (u/t)^2\right) + f\left((u/t)^2 - t/u\right) = f(2) - 2 + 2 f(u/t)^2. $$
> This is true by Lemma 4 since $u/t \neq 0$.

Now, let $D = f(\sqrt[3]{2})$.
From Lemma 5, by plugging $t = \sqrt[3]{2}$ and $u = -1$, we get
$$
\begin{align*}
2 f(1) &= 2 (f(2) + f(-1)) + (f(2) - 2) (D + 1) D \\
0 &= 2 (f(2) - 2) + (f(2) - 2) (D + 1) D \\
&= (f(2) - 2) (D - 2) (D + 1).
\end{align*}
$$
If $D = -1$, then $f(\sqrt[3]{2}) = f(-1)$.
But $\sqrt[3]{2} \neq -1$; a contradiction.
So, either $f(2) = 2$ or $D = f(\sqrt[3]{2}) = 2$.
The latter yields $f(2) = 2^3 = 8$.

For $f(2) = 2$, Lemma 5 yields $2 f(t^3 + u^3) = 2 (f(t)^3 + f(u)^3)$.
Cancelling $2$ out, using multiplicativity, and replacing $t$ and $u$ with cube roots yield that $f$ is additive.

For $f(2) = 8$, Lemma 5 instead yields $2 f(t^3 + u^3) = 2 (f(t) + f(u))^3$.
Again, cancel $2$ out and replace $t$ and $u$ with cube roots.
Letting $g(x) = f(\sqrt[3]{x})$ for any $x \in \R$, this yields $g(t + u)^3 = (g(t) + g(u))^3$.
While $a^3 = b^3$ does not necessarily imply $a = b$ for $a, b \in R$ in general, we can cancel out cubes with the following lemma.
First, for any $t, u, v \in \R$ with $t + u + v = 0$, we get $(g(t) + g(u))^3 + g(v)^3 = 0$.

> __Lemma 6__:
> Let $S$ be a commutative monoid and $R$ be an integral domain.
> Let $g : S \to R$ be a function such that $(g(t) + g(u))^3 + g(v)^3 = 0$ for any $t, u, v \in S$ with $t + u + v = 0$.

>
> __Proof__:
> Fix any $t, u, v \in S$ with $t + u + v = 0$.
> Then we get $(g(t) + g(u))^3 + g(v)^3 = 0$.
> If $char(R) = 3$, then the equation becomes $(g(t) + g(u) + g(v))^3 = 0$.
> Then we get $g(t) + g(u) + g(v) = 0$ since $R$ is an integral domain.
>
> Now suppose that $char(R) \neq 3$ and $g(t) + g(u) + g(v) \neq 0$.
> Dividing by $g(t) + g(u) + g(v)$, we get $g(t)^2 + g(u)^2 + g(v)^2 + 2 g(t) g(u) - g(u) g(v) - g(v) g(t) = 0$.
> Permuting the variables, we also get $g(t)^2 + g(u)^2 + g(v)^2 - g(t) g(u) + 2 g(u) g(v) - g(v) g(t) = 0$.
Subtracting the two equations, we get $3 g(u) (g(v) - g(t)) = 0$.
> Since $char(R) \neq 3$, this yields either $g(u) = 0$ or $g(v) = g(t)$.
> Again, permuting the variables, we get either $g(v) = 0$ or $g(t) = g(u)$, and either $g(t) = 0$ or $g(u) = g(v)$.

# Implementation Details

We have to manually define the complete third root in $\R$ as we need it for our proof.



# Note

When $f$ is not injective, $R$ can be an arbitrary ring; it does not even have to be commutative.
In the `A8.lean` file, we reflect this by only putting the integral domain property only for the injective case.
