# IMO 2021 A8, Generalized Version

Let $R$ be an integral domain.
Find all functions $f : \R \to R$ such that, for all $a, b, c \in \R$,
$$ (f(a) - f(b)) (f(b) - f(c)) (f(c) - f(a)) = f(ab^2 + bc^2 + ca^2) - f(a^2 b + b^2 c + c^2 a). \tag{*} $$







# Answer

Either $f = C$, $f = x \mapsto \pm \phi(x) + C$, or $f = x \mapsto \pm \phi(x)^3 + C$ for some ring homomorphism $\phi : \R \to R$ and $C \in R$.







# Solution

We call a function $f : \R \to R$ good if it satisfies $(*)$.
It is easy to check that, for any good function $f$, $-f$ is good and $f + C$ is good for any constant $C \in R$.
Thus, we may WLOG assume that $f(0) = 0$ whenever necessary.
This also means that one only has to check that the zero map is good and, for any ring homomorphism $\phi : \R \to R$, $\phi$ and $x \mapsto \phi(x)^3$ works.
Checking for the zero map and the ring homomorphism as a map itself is straightforward.
However, checking for $x \mapsto \phi(x)^3$ is not.

(In the corresponding `.lean` file, we just use `ring` tactic and let the computer check the identity.)

Now, let $f$ be an arbitrary good function.
We divide into two, rather lengthy cases.



## Case 1: $f$ is not injective.

We prove that $f$ must be constant.

For any $a, b \in \R$ such that $f(a) = f(b)$, $(*)$ gives us
$$ \forall c \in \R, \quad f(ab^2 + bc^2 + ca^2) = f(a^2 b + b^2 c + c^2 a). \tag{1} $$
We play with this equality until we that $f$ is constant.

By $(1)$, if $f(a) = f(0)$ for some $a \in \R$, then $f(a^2 c) = f(ac^2)$ for any $c \in \R$.
Swapping $c$ with $-c$ and comparing gives us $f(ac^2) = f(-ac^2)$.
If $a$ is positive, then replacing $c$ with $\sqrt{c/a}$ gives us $f(c) = f(-c)$ for any $c \in \R$, so $f$ is even.
When $a$ is non-negative, we instead replace $c$ with $\sqrt{c/(-a)}$ to get that $f$ is even.
Either way, if $f(a) = f(0)$ for some $a \in \R \setminus \{0\}$, then $f$ is even.

Now, suppose that $f$ is even.
For an arbitrary $x \in \R$, plugging $a = x$, $b = -x$, and $c = dx$ into $(1)$ for an arbitrary $d \in \R$ gives us
$$ f(x^3 - d^2 x^3 + dx^3) = f(-x^3 + dx^3 + d^2 x^3), $$
$$ f(x^3 (1 + d - d^2)) = f(x^3 (-1 + d + d^2)). $$
Using $d = \phi = \dfrac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$ gives us $f(2 \phi x^3) = f(0)$ for any $x \in \R$.
Now, replace $x$ with $\sqrt[3]{x/(2 \phi)}$ to get that $f$ is indeed constant.
Thus, it remains to show that, if $f$ is not injective, then $f(x) = f(0)$ for some $x \in \R$.

For convenience, we call a real number $t$ _special_ if $f(tx) = f(x)$ for some $x \in \R \setminus \{0\}$. It is easy to check that, if $t \neq 0$ is a special real number, then $t^{-1}$ is also special.
Now, since $f$ is not injective, there exists $x, t \in \R$ with $x \neq 0$ and $t \neq 1$ such that $f(tx) = f(x)$.
That is, there exists a special real number not equal to $1$, say $t_0$.
We will work with this special number.

Let $t$ be a special real number, and consider some $x \neq 0$ such that $f(tx) = f(x)$.
Replacing $a$, $b$, and $c$ with $tx$, $x$, and $dx$ for arbitrary $d \in \R$ in $(1)$ gives us
$$ f(x^3 (t + d^2 + t^2 d)) = f(x^3 (t^2 + d + d^2 t)). \tag{2} $$
With this equation, we proceed with the following lemmas.

__Lemma 1.1__:
> If $t$ is a special number, then $t^4$ is also special.

__Proof__:
> The lemma clearly holds for $t = 0$, so now assume that $t \neq 0$.
> Pick some $x \neq 0$ such that $f(tx) = f(x)$.
> Now, plugging $d = -t^2$ into $(2)$ gives us $f(x^3 t) = f(x^3 t^5)$.
> Since $x, t \neq 0$, this means that $t^4$ is indeed special.

Since $t_0 \neq 1$, we have either $t_0 \leq 0$, $0 < t_0 < 1$, or $t_0 > 1$.
In the second case, $t_0^{-1}$ is also special and $t_0^{-1} > 1$.
So, without loss of generality, we can assume that either $t_0 \leq 0$ or $t_0 > 1$.
Next, by Lemma 1.1 and small induction, for any special real number $t$ and $n \in \Z_{\geq 0}$, $t^{4^n}$ is also special.
In the case $t_0 > 1$, there must exist $n \geq 0$ such that $t_0^{4^n} > 2$.
Then, replacing $t_0$ with $t_0^{4^n}$, we can assume WLOG that $t_0 > 2$.
We now finish this case with the following lemma.

__Lemma 1.2__:
> If there exists a special number $t$ with either $t \leq 0$ or $t > 2$, then $0$ is special.

In particular, there exists $x \neq 0$ such that $f(x) = f(0)$, and we are done.

__Proof__:
> If $t = 0$, then we are done, so now assume that either $t < 0$ or $t > 2$.
> Let $x$ be a non-zero real number such that $f(tx) = f(x)$.
> As a quadratic polynomial in $d$, the discriminant of $P(d) = d^2 + t^2 d + t$ is $t^4 - 4t$, which is non-negative for both $t < 0$ and $t > 2$.
> In particular, $P$ has a real root, say $d$.
> Thus, using the same $x$, $t$, and $d$ in $(2)$ gives us $f(x^3 (t^2 + d + d^2 t)) = f(0)$.
> Since $x \neq 0$, it remains to show that $t^2 + d + d^2 t \neq 0$.
>
> The equation $d^2 + t^2 d + t = 0$ can be rearranged to $d^2 + t = -t^2 d$.
> Then $t^2 + d + d^2 t = (d^2 + t) t + d = -t^3 d + d = (1 - t^3) d$.
> Since $d$ is a root of the polynomial $d^2 + t^2 d + t$ with $t \neq 0$, we have $d \neq 0$.
> Since we have either $t < 0$ or $t > 2$, we have $1 - t^3 \neq 0$.
> This proves the lemma.



## Case 2: $f$ is injective.

We will thoroughly assume that $f(0) = 0$ in this case.
First, we prove that $f(1) = \pm 1$, and that $f$ is multiplicative if $f(1) = 1$.

__Lemma 2.1__:
> We have $f(1) = \pm 1$.
> Also, if $f(1) = 1$, then $f$ is multiplicative.

__Proof__:
> ...







# Implementation Details

We have to manually define the complete third root in $\R$ as we need it for our proof.
