# IMO 2021 A8, Generalized Version

Let $R$ be an integral domain.
Find all functions $f : \R \to R$ such that, for all $a, b, c \in \R$,
$$ (f(a) - f(b)) (f(b) - f(c)) (f(c) - f(a)) = f(ab^2 + bc^2 + ca^2) - f(a^2 b + b^2 c + c^2 a). \tag{*} $$



# Answer

Either $f = C$, $f = x \mapsto \pm \phi(x) + C$, or $f = x \mapsto \pm \phi(x)^3 + C$ for some ring homomorphism $\phi : \R \to R$ and $C \in R$.

This is a solution in the AoPS thread for IMO 2021 A8 by __BlazingMuddy__ (post #8).
We will rewrite the solution here.

# Implementation Details

We have to manually define the complete third root in $\R$ as we need it for our proof.



# Note

When $f$ is not injective, $R$ can be an arbitrary ring; it does not even have to be commutative.
In the `A8.lean` file, we reflect this by only putting the integral domain property only for the injective case.
