# IMO 2021 A8, Generalized Version

Let $R$ be an integral domain.
Find all functions $f : \R \to R$ such that, for all $a, b, c \in \R$,
$$ (f(a) - f(b)) (f(b) - f(c)) (f(c) - f(a)) = f(ab^2 + bc^2 + ca^2) - f(a^2 b + b^2 c + c^2 a). $$



# Answer

Either $f = C$, $f = x \mapsto \pm \phi(x) + C$, or $f = x \mapsto \pm \phi(x)^3 + C$ for some ring homomorphism $\phi : \R \to R$ and $C \in R$.

The first referenced link is a solution to the case where $f$ is injective.
The second referenced link can be adapted for the case where $f$ is not injective.
However, the second link does not deal with arbitrary integral domains as the co-domain.
The first link does not either, but it is adaptable to any domains as a co-domain of $f$.
