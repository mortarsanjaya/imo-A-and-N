# IMO 2009 A5, Slightly Generalized Version

Let $F$ be a linear ordered field.
Prove that, for any function $f : F \to F$, there exists real numbers $x$ and $y$ such that
$$ f(x - f(y)) > yf(x) + x. $$



# Solution

Official solution: <https://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2009SL.pdf>

The official solution only uses the linear ordered field property of $\R$.
Thus we can easily generalize it to any linear ordered field.
