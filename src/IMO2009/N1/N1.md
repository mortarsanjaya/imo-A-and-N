# IMO 2009 N1 (P1)

Let $n$ be a positive integer and $k \geq 1$.
Let $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{k + 1}$ be distinct integers in the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ such that $n \mid a_i (a_{i + 1} - 1)$ for every $i \leq k$.
Prove that $n \nmid a_{k + 1} (a_1 - 1)$.



# Solution

Official solution: <https://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2009SL.pdf>

We will over-generalize, first with commutative monoids.
Let $M$ be a commutative monoid, $k \geq 1$, and $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k$ be elements of $M$.
Suppose that $a_i a_{i + 1} = a_i$ for each $i \leq k$, where we denote $a_{k + 1} = a_1$.
We claim that $a_i = a_j$ for each $i, j \leq k$.
The idea from Solution 3 of the official solution proves this claim.
That is, we just prove that all of them equals $a_1 a_2 \ldots a_k$.

Next we present a version of the above claim with commutative rings.
Let $R$ be a commutative ring, $k \geq 1$, and $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k$ be elements of $R$.
Suppose that $a_i (a_{i + 1} - 1) = 0$ for each $i \leq k$, where we denote $a_{k + 1} = a_1$.
Then $a_i = a_j$ for each $i, j \leq k$.
To prove this result, one just manipulates to get $a_i a_{i + 1} = a_i$ and use the previous paragraph.

To solve the original problem, suppose for the sake of contradiction that $n \mid a_{k + 1} (a_1 - 1)$.
Then the above claim with $R = \Z/n\Z$ gives us $a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{n}$ for each $i < j$.
But this contradicts the fact that $1 \leq a_1, a_2 \leq n$ and $a_1 \neq a_2$; note that $2 \leq k + 1$.



# Implementation notes

For convenience, we will implement $a_1, \ldots, a_{k + 1}$ as a $k + 1$-periodic sequence, starting at $0$.
