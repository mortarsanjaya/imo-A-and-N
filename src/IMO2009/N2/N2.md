# IMO 2009 N2

For each positive integer $n$, let $\Omega(n)$ denote the number of prime factors of $n$, counting multiplicity.
For $n = 0$, we denote $\Omega(0) = 0$.
1. Prove that for any $N \geq 0$, there exists distinct integers $a$ and $b$ such that $\Omega((a + k)(b + k))$ is even for all $0 \leq k < N$.
2. Prove that for any positive integers $a$ and $b$, if $\Omega((a + k)(b + k))$ is even for all $k \geq 0$, then $a = b$.

Official solution: <https://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2009SL.pdf>

Note that originally, part 1 only considers the case $N = 50$.
Also, we use $0 \leq k < N$ in part 1 and $k \geq 0$ in part 2 for implementation convenience.
The original problem considers $1 \leq k \leq N = 50$ and $k \geq 1$, respectively.
