# IMO 2007 N6 (P5)

Let $n > 1$, $a$, and $b$ be positive integers such that $nab - 1 \mid (na^2 - 1)^2$.
Prove that $a = b$.



# Solution

Official solution: <https://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2007SL.pdf>

The version formalized here (and put into the IMO as P5) is the big lemma presented in the solution.
Note that the same solution does not work for $n = 1$.
In fact, for each $c > 0$, there exists infinitely many $a > b > 0$ such that $c(ab - 1) = (a - b)^2$, and each such $a$ and $b$ easily leads to $ab - 1 \mid (a^2 - 1)^2$.
One can, however, show using the same technique that a solution $(a, b)$ for the equation must be two consecutive terms of the sequence $1, 1, c + 1, c^2 + 3c + 1, \ldots$, defined by $x_0 = x_1 = 1$ and $x_{n + 2} = (c + 2) x_{n + 1} - x_n$ for each $n \geq 0$.
We will *not* do the construction for $n = 1$.
