\subsection*{Problem}

Fix an integer $b > 0$ and $n \geq 0$.
Suppose that for each positive integer $k$, there exists an integer $a$ such that $k \mid b - a^n$.
Prove that $b = A^n$ for some integer $A$.


\subsubsection*{Extra Problem}

Prove that, in any finite field $F$, there exists $a \in F$ such that $a^8 = 16$.



\subsection*{Solution}

Official solution: \url{https://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2007SL.pdf}

As in the official solution, we pick $k = b^2$.
However, there is a very short solution as follows.

Since $b^2 \mid b - c^n$ for some integer $c$, we can write $c^n = b - ab^2 = (1 - ab) b$ for some integer $a$.
But $1 - ab$ and $b$ are coprime, so indeed $b$ must be an $n^{\text{th}}$ power.


\subsubsection*{Solution for Extra Problem}

If either $2$ or $-2$ is a square in $F$, then we are done.
Indeed, we can pick $a \in F$ such that $a^2 = \pm 2$, and thus $a^8 = 16$.
Otherwise, $-1$ must be a square in $F$.
Take some $i \in F$ such that $i^2 = -1$.
Then $(1 + i)^2 = 2i$, and thus $(1 + i)^8 = (2i)^4 = 16$.



\subsection*{Extra notes}

The extra is mentioned in the comment section of the official solution.
It emphasizes that $k$ cannot be restricted to primes only; $16$ is not an $8^{\text{th}}$ power.

We will implement the extra problem in \texttt{N2\_extra.lean}.
