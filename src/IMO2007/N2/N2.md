# IMO 2007 N2

Let $b$ and $n$ be non-negative integers.
Suppose that for each positive integer $k$, there exists an integer $a_k$ such that $k \mid b - a_k^n$.
Prove that $b = A^n$ for some integer $A$.



# Solution

Official solution: <https://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2007SL.pdf>

We will not follow the official solution, except for picking $k = b^2$.
A simpler approach is as follows.
Since $b^2 \mid b - c^n$ for some integer $c$, we can write $c^n = b - ab^2 = (1 - ab) b$ for some integer $a$.
But $1 - ab$ and $b$ are coprime, so indeed $b$ must be $n$th power.
