# IMO 2012 N1

A set $A$ of integers is called admissible if it has the following property:
  for any $x, y \in A$ and $k \in \Z$, we have $x^2 + kxy + y^2 \in A$.
Determine all pairs $(m, n)$ of integers such that the only admissible set containing $m$ and $n$ is $\Z$.



# Answer

The pair $(m, n)$ satisfies the condition if and only if $m$ and $n$ are coprime.
