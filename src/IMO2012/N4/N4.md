# IMO 2012 N4

An integer $a$ is called friendly if there exists positive integers $m$ and $n$ such that $(m^2 + n)(n^2 + m) = a(m - n)^3$.

1. Prove that the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, 2012\}$ contains at least $500$ friendly integers.
2. Decide if $2$ is friendly.



# Answer for part 2

$2$ is not friendly.

# Implementation Details

Rather than using the `pnat` type, we just use `int` type even for the positive integers.
We just manually add the positive criterion when emphasizing positive integers.

For part 1, to ease up formalization, we use the `fin` datatype.
Also, instead of solving part 1 as is, we prove an easy generalization of part 1: $\{1, 2, \ldots, 4n\}$ contains at least $n$ friendly integers for each $n \geq 0$.
