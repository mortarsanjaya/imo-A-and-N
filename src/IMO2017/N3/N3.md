# IMO 2017 N3

Determine all integers $n \geq 2$ such that for any integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ whose sum is not divisible by $n$, there exists $1 \leq i \leq n$ such that, for any $0 \leq j < n$,
$$ n \nmid \sum_{k = i}^{i + j} a_i. $$
Here, we let $a_i = a_{i - n}$ for $i > n$.



# Answer

The primes.



# Solution

Official solution: <http://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2017SL.pdf>



# Implementation notes

We will use periodic function to represent $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$.
Furthermore, this means that there is no need to impose the restriction $1 \leq i \leq n$.
