# IMO 2017 N7 (P6)

Let $n$ be a positive integer and $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)$ be distinct pairs of coprime integers.
Show that there exists a non-constant homogenous polynomial $f : \Z[x, y]$ such that $f(x_i, y_i) = 1$ for each $i \leq n$.



# Solution

Official solution: <http://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2017SL.pdf>

We follow Solution 2 of the official solution.



# Implementation notes

We represent the two-variable polynomials using `mv_polynomial bool ℤ`.
In particular, we have to represent the pairs using `bool → ℤ`.

There is no need to assume `0 < n`.
The case `n = 0` is trivial.
