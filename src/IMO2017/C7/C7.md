# IMO 2017 C7

For any finite set $X \subseteq \N$, denote by $f_X(k)$ the $k^{\text{th}}$ smallest natural number not in $X$, indexed from $0$.
For any finite sets $X, Y \subseteq \N$, denote $X * Y = X \cup \{f_X(y) : y \in Y\}$.
Also, for any finite set $X \subseteq \N$ and $k \geq 0$, define $X^k$ recursively by $X^0 = \emptyset$ and $X^{k + 1} = X * X^k$.

Let $A$ and $B$ be finite subsets of $\N$, and suppose that $A * B = B * A$.
Prove that $A^{|B|} = B^{|A|}$.



# Solution

Official solution: <http://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2017SL.pdf>

We follow Solution 1.



# Implementation notes

The original formulation uses positive integers, for both the supersets of $X$ and $Y$ and also the indexing set.
We use non-negative integers for implementation convenience.
Also, the original formulation asks only for the case where $A$ and $B$ are non-empty.
Due to our definition, we can extend to the empty case.
