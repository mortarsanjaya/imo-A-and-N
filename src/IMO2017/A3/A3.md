# IMO 2017 A3

Let $S$ be a finite set.
Fix some $f : S \to S$.
Suppose that, for any $g : S \to S$, $f \circ g \circ f = g \circ f \circ g$ implies $g = f$.
Prove that $f(f(S)) = f(S)$.



# Solution

Official solution: <http://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2017SL.pdf>

We follow most of the official solution.
However, most of the results we will prove are a generalized version, replacing $S \to S$ with arbitrary finite monoids.
Only at the final step do we go back focusing on $f$ as a function $S \to S$.

We use $f^{n + 3} = f^{2n + 3}$ for the claim as opposed to $f^{n + 2} = f^{2n + 1}$.
