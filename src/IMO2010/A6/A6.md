# IMO 2010 A6

Consider functions $f, g : \N \to \N$ such that $f(g(n)) = f(n) + 1$ and $g(f(n)) = g(n) + 1$ for every $n \in \N$.
Prove that $f = g$.



# Solution

Official solution: <https://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2010SL.pdf>

We follow Solution 1.
However, for convenience, we use $\N = \{0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots\}$.
Indeed, one can recover the original formulation by changing $f$ with $f(n - 1) + 1$ and changing $g$ similarly.

The comment section of the official solution also mentions a characterization of all functions $f : \N \to \N$ satisfying $f(f(n)) = f(n) + 1$ for all $n \in \N$.
We implement this characterization in `A6_extra.lean`.
