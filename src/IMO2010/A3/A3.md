# IMO 2010 A3, Generalized Version

Fix a positive integer $n$.
Let $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{2n}$ be non-negative real numbers such that $x_i + x_{i + 1} + x_{i + 2} \leq 1$ for all $i = 1, 2, \ldots, 2n$ (where $x_{2n + 1} = x_1$ and $x_{2n + 2} = x_2$).
Find the maximal possible value of $\sum_{i = 1}^{2n} x_i x_{i + 2}$.



# Answer

$\dfrac{n}{4}$.



# Solution

Official solution: <https://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2010SL.pdf>

We follow Solution 1, generalizing as in the comment section of the solution.
In fact, we will implement the sequence $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{2n}$ as a $2n$-periodic map $x : \N \to \R_{\geq 0}$ with $x_i + x_{i + 1} + x_{i + 2} \leq 1$ for all $i \geq 0$.
