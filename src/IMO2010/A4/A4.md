# IMO 2010 A4

Define the sequence $x_1, x_2, \ldots$ by $x_1 = 1$, $x_{2k} = -x_k$, and $x_{2k - 1} = (-1)^{k + 1} x_k$ for all $k \geq 1$.
Prove that $x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_n \geq 0$ for all $n \geq 1$.



# Solution

Official solution: <https://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2010SL.pdf>

We follow Solution 2.
However, we use $\N$ as the indexing set.
That is, the sequence we are working is instead $x_0, x_1, x_2, \ldots$ defined by $x_0 = 1$, $x_{2k} = (-1)^k x_k$, and $x_{2k + 1} = -x_k$ for all $k \geq 0$.

We also prove the extra part mentioned in the comment.
That is, $S_k = 0$ if and only if $k$ contains only $0$ and $2$ in its base-$4$ representation.



# Implementation details

Instead of defining a sequence of $\pm 1$s, we define a sequence of boolean.
We also add a function `bool_int : bool → ℤ` mapping `ff` to `1` and `tt` to `-1`.
