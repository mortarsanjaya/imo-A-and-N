Determine all functions $f : \R â†’ \R$ such that, for all $x, y \in \R$,
$$ f(\lfloor x \rfloor y) = f(x) \lfloor f(y) \rfloor. $$



# Answer

$f = C$ for some $C \in \{0\} \cup [1, 2)$.



# Solution

Official solution: <https://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2010SL.pdf>

We will follow the ideas from Solution 1 of the official solution.
However, we will simplify the proof as follows.

First, plugging $x = y = 0$ yields $f(0) = f(0) \lfloor f(0) \rfloor$.
This means that either $\lfloor f(0) \rfloor = 1$ or $f(0) = 0$.
For the former case, plugging $y = 0$ yields $f(0) = f(x)$ for all $x \in \R$.
That is $f = C$ for some $C \in [1, 2)$.

For the latter case, we prove that $f = 0$.
Plugging $x = 1$ yields $f(y) = f(1) \lfloor f(y) \rfloor$ for all $y \in \R$.
In particular, to obtain $f = 0$, it suffices to prove that $f(1) = 0$.
Now, plugging in $x = y = 1/2$ yields $f(1/2) \lfloor f(1/2) \rfloor = 0$.
This forces $\lfloor f(1/2) \rfloor = 0$.
Finally, plugging in $x = 2$ and $y = 1/2$ now yields $f(1) = 0$, as desired.
