Determine all functions $f : \R → \R$ such that, for all $x, y \in \R$,
$$ f(⌊x⌋ y) = f(x) ⌊f(y)⌋. $$

## Answer

$f = C$ for some $C ∈ \{0\} \cup [1, 2)$.

## Solution

See https://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2010SL.pdf.

We will follow Solution 1 up to obtaining $f = C$ for $C \in [1, 2)$.
For the case $f(0) = 0$, we do the following steps to obtain $f = 0$.

Plugging in $x = 1$ yields $f(y) = f(1) ⌊f(y)⌋$ for all $y ∈ ℝ$.
In particular, to obtain $f = 0$, it suffices to prove that $f(1) = 0$.
Now, plugging in $x = y = 1/2$ yields $f(1/2) ⌊f(1/2)⌋ = 0$ since $⌊1/2⌋ = 0$.
This forces $⌊f(1/2)⌋ = 0$.
Finally, plugging in $x = 2$ and $y = 1/2$ now yields $f(1) = 0$, as desired.
