# IMO 2006 A2

Define the sequence of real numbers $a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots$ recursively by $a_0 = -1$ and, for all $n \geq 1$,
$$ \sum_{k = 0}^n \frac{a_k}{n - k + 1} = 0. $$
Prove that $a_n > 0$ for $n \geq 1$.

# Implementation notes

We will have to stick with just describing the equations as another hypothesis.
If it is possible, we should construct the sequence recursively.

We also abstract away the properties of real and instead formalize the result for linear ordered fields.
