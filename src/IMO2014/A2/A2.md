# IMO 2014 A2

Let $F$ be a linear ordered archimedean commutative ring with $2$ being invertible.
Define the function $f : F \to F$ by
$$ f(x) = \begin{cases} x + 1/2, & x < 1/2, \\ x^2, & x \geq 1/2. \end{cases} $$
Let $a, b \in F$ such that $0 < a, b < 1$ and $(f^{n + 1}(a) - f^n(a))(f^{n + 1}(b) - f^n(b)) \geq 0$ for all $n \geq 0$.
Prove that $a = b$.

# Note

The version that we presented is a contrapositive of the original formulation.
We also generalize $\R$ to any linear ordered archimedean commutative rings with $2$ being invertible.
