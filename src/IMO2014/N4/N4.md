# IMO 2014 N4

Let $n > 1$ be a positive integer.
Prove that there exists infinitely many positive integer $k$ such that $\lfloor n^k/k \rfloor$ is odd.



# Solution

Official solution: <https://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2014SL.pdf>

We follow Solution 1 of the official solution.
However, for the case where $n > 2$ and $n$ is even, we use powers of $n - 1$ as opposed to powers of a prime factor of $n - 1$.


# Implementation details

We use $\N$ as opposed to $\N+$.
Indeed, $n$ and $k$ can be relaxed to natural numbers.
The condition $n > 1$ means $n$ is a positive integer regardless, and the inclusion of $k = 0$ does not affect the problem at all.
