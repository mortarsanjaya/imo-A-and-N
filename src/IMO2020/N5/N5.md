# IMO 2020 N5, Weak Generalized Version

Fix a torsion-free commutative (additive) cancellative monoid $M$.
Denote $\N^+ = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots\}$.
We call a function $f : \N^+ \to M$ *additive* if $f(xy) = f(x) + f(y)$ for every $x, y \in \N^+$.
Given an additive map $f : \N^+ \to M$, we say that $f$ is *$n$-good* for a positive integer $n$ if $f(k) = f(n - k)$ for all $k < n$,

Find all additive maps $f : \N^+ \to M$ such that $f$ is $n$-good for infinitely many positive integers $n$.



# Answer

$f = 0$ or $f = n \mapsto \nu_p(n) \cdot c$ for some $c \in M \setminus \{0\}$.



# Solution

Referenece: `N5_extra.md`

We considered an even more general version without the torsion-free condition on $M$.
The main lemmas we will take are Lemma 1.3 and Lemma 2.1.
We also borrow the *wide* and *$p$-strong* terminology; see the referenced file for the definitions.

Clearly all the maps in the answer section satisfies the requirement; they are $p$-strong.
Conversely, suppose that $f : \N^+ \to M$ is an additive map that is $n$-good for infinitely many $n$.
Then either $f$ is wide or $f$ is $p$-strong for some prime $p$.
In both cases, we proceed with the following lemma, which uses Lemma 1.3 of the referenced file.

> __Lemma__:
> If $f$ is $p$-good for some prime $p$, then $f(k) = 0$ for all $0 < k < p$.
>
> __Proof__:
> By small induction with Lemma 1.3, one can prove that $f([k^t]_p) = t \cdot f(k)$ for any $0 < k < p$ and $t \geq 0$.
> Now set $t = p - 1$, and then use Fermat's little theorem to get $(p - 1) \cdot f(k) = f(1) = 0$.
> But $M$ is assumed to be torsion-free, so $f(k) = 0$.

In particular, if $f$ is wide, then we get $f(k) = 0$ for all $k \in \N^+$; just take $p$ large enough and apply the above lemma.

On the other hand, suppose that $f$ is $p$-strong for some prime $p$.
By the above lemma and Lemma 2.1, for any $t \in \N^+$ such that $p \nmid t$, we have $f(t) = f([t]_p) = 0$.
This means $f(n) = \nu_p(n) \cdot f(p)$ for all $n \in \N^+$, as desired.



# Note

The official solution does not work even in the case $M = \Z$.
It requires the canonical ordering property on $M$ that $\N$ has, but $\Z$ does not have.

The `N5.lean` file is basically about results on wide and $p$-strong additive maps on torsion-free case.
