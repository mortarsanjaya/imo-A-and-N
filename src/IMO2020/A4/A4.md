# IMO 2020 A4 (P2), Generalized Version

Let $n \geq 2$ be a positive integer.
Let $a, x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ be positive real numbers such that $a \geq x_i$ for each $i \leq n$ and $a + \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i = 1$.
Prove that
$$ (3 - 2a) a^a \prod_{i = 1}^n x_i^{x_i} < 1. $$



# Solution

Official solution: <https://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2020SL.pdf>

The problem presented above is almost entirely different from the official problem.
However, the method that we will use still derives from the idea in the official solution.

For $a < 1/2$, as in Solution 2, we just use $x_i \leq a$ for each $i$:
$$ a^a \prod_{i = 1}^n x_i^{x_i} \leq a^{a + \sum_{i \leq n} x_i} = a. $$
But $1 - (3 - 2a) a = (1 - a)(1 - 2a) > 0$ for $a < 1/2$, so $(3 - 2a) a < 1$.

For $1/2 \leq a < 1$, as in Solution 1, we use the weighted AM-GM inequality:
$$ a^a \prod_{i = 1}^n x_i^{x_i} \leq a^2 + \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i^2 < a^2 + (1 - a)^2. $$
That means we are left to prove that $(3 - 2a) (a^2 + (1 - a)^2) \leq 1$.
Indeed, $1 - (3 - 2a) (a^2 + (1 - a)^2) = 2 (1 - a)^2 (2a - 1) > 0$ for any $a \geq 1/2$.



# Note

We will also present the original problem.
The one extra inequality we need to apply is $a + 2b + 3c + 4d \leq a + 3(b + c + d) = 3 - 2a$, which holds since $b \geq d$.
